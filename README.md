# battletech-tutorial-skip

Allows you to easily enable and disable a skip for the battletech tutorial/intro

## Usage

- Compile, or download a [release from here](https://github.com/smt923/battletech-tutorial-skip/releases)

- stick the binary into your Battletech install folder (along with the game's own files, and more importantly the `BattleTech_Data` folder)

- run `battletech-tutorial-skip`, everything else is prompted

## Info

Based on [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleTechMods/comments/8f0fq7/if_anyones_interested_ive_figured_out_how_to_skip/) and may possibly break or become useless in the future, this program won't back up the file but shouldn't mess anything up either, if it does you can verify files on steam to get back the original

if you'd like to be safe you can make a backup of `milestone_003_title_coronation_palace.json` inside `BattleTech_Data\StreamingAssets\data\milestones`
